## Introduction & Project Overview
Data storage forms one of the central blocks for the backend of a mobile application. In Mini Project 3, we've learned how to work with online data storage using Firebase realtime database and storage. However, there are times where we can just as conveniently store everything locally (for this app, we will be using `sqlite`). This project is designed to give you the foundation of working with everything `"off the cloud"`.

The goal of this application is to design and create an Inventory App for MDB that allows its members to keep track of its spending on food, socials, and retreats. The app will need to store information about the cost for each spending, a brief description of what was purchased, the name of the supplying merchant(s), and the date of the purchase. It will also have functionalities that allow MDB members to track and monitor the spending progress so they can make better planning in the future.

## Project Structure
In order to guide you through this project, I've divided it into multiple parts. At the end of each part, you are supposed to have completed a functionality of the application. I will also provide recommended deadline for each part, although the amount of time allocated for each part is completely up to you.

To build this inventory app, let's try to have a basic understanding of how data storage works locally:

The way local data storage works is quite similar to that with Firebase, you send out a request in the native application language (Java) in this case, the language gets interpreted by the helper library and transformed into the semantically equivalent SQL commands to query the local database. For some of the query you send out such as `SELECT` in sqlite, your command will also trigger the database return a response, which gets translated back by the library to something that you can work with in the Android environment.
